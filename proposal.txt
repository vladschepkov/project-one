Our proposal: We have a Spotify dataset pulled from Spotify's API.
It has 18.8k rows and 18 columns. This dataset contains song information including popularity,
loudness, tempo, acousticness, genre, etc. 
We will work with the data to see if we can find any variable that correlates with song popularity.
Ideally, we will build a regression formula that will allow us to predict song popularity, based on
these song variables.
